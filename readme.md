#VsChromium

VsChromium is a Visual Studio Extension containing a collection of tools useful for editing, navigating and debugging code.

VsChromium was originally developed to help when contributing code to the Chromium project, but has evolved over time to become a more general purpose extension that can be useful for any project. See the [Feature summary](http://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/#feature-summary) and [Getting started](http://chromium.github.io/vs-chromium/#getting-started) sections for more information.
