<h1>Chromium Explorer - Opening files and indexing</h1>

<p>Once the Chromium Explorer tool winow is active, it detects when a source
file from a local Chromium enlistment is opened in the Visual Studio
editor and starts indexing <bold>all</bold> source files from that enlistement.
The indexing process typically takes only about 10 seconds on a modern
multi-core machine with an SSD drive.</p>

<p class="warning">Warning: The indexing process can take significantly
longer if the enlistment is located on an HDD drive. This is expected, as
the indexing process has to read 90,000+ source files from disk.
An HDD makes this process a lot slower due to disk seek times.</p>

<p class="warning">Warning: We also saw significant performance degradation on a SSD
when "Real Time" disk activity monitoring of certain Anti Virus programs is
active. This can be easily worked around by configuring the Anti Virus software
to exclude the directory containing the local Chromium enlistment.</p>

<p class="note">
Note: The "indexing" process is technically very straighforward: after
enumerating all the files and directories of the Chromium enlistement, relevant
source files are all loaded in memory so they can be searched extremely
efficiently later on. This process assumes there is enough memory
available to keep all files in physical memory. With a recent (as of October
2013) Chromium enlistment, this requires about 1.5GB of memory.</p>

<p class="note">
Note: Similar to the coding style checkers, there is no requirement to have
a Chromium solution/project open, although having one doesn't hurt either.</p>

<p>Once the indexing process is over (there are progress indicators in the UI),
the Chromium Explorer tool window displays a tree containing the files and
directories of the enlistment.</p>
